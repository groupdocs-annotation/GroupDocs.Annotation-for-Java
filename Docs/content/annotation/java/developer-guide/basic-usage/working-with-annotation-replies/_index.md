## What are Annotation Replies?

**Annotation replies** are the commenting feature of Microsoft Office, PDF, and other document formats that allows to store written discussion inside a document and provides an effective way for users to collaborate during document review and redaction. Different software vendors provide their own way for commenting and annotating document content, so when you need to collaborate over various document types it’s required to have multiple applications installed on every collaborator’s device.   
Fortunately **[GroupDocs.Annotation for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/annotation/java)** provides an easy and convenient API to add, edit or delete annotation replies for wide range of supported document formats within your application.

Please check the guides below to learn more about how to add, change and remove annotation replies with several lines of code.
